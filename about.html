    I graduated from Telecom Paris in 2019 and obtained my French engineer diploma (equivalen to MEng) specialised in data science and image processing. In 2019, I also obtained my MSc with distinction in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence from Imperial College London. After joining the Smart Medical Imaging CDT, I obtained a MRes in Healthcare Technologies from King's College London with the highest overall score.
