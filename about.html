<span class="fa fa-user-graduate about-icon"></span>
I graduated from <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/"> Telecom Paris</a> in 2019 and obtained an Engineer's degree (MEng) specialised in Data Science and Image Processing. At Telecom Paris, I was really interested in applying deep learning models, especially convolution neural networks to imaging datasets, including medical data, natural imaging and satellite imaging.
