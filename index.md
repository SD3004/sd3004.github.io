I am a PhD student at King's College London, in the School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences and member of the [MeTriCs Lab](https://metrics-lab.github.io/). My PhD project is sueprvised by [Dr.Emma C. Robinson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=fr&user=WXAAOb0AAAAJ) and [Pr. Daniel Rueckert](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H0O0WnQAAAAJ&hl=fr).

My research work lies in developing new deep learning methods for studying neuroimaging data, especially for MRI and fMRI, with a particular interest in studying neonatal cortical development and neurological disorders. Currently, I am developing deep learning methodologies for studying the brain surface using vision transformers. 

<em>I am a computer science engineer, graduated from Telecom Paris in 2019. I also have a MSc. in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from Imperial College London (2019), and an MRes in Healthcare Technologies from King's College London (2021). </em>
