Hello ! My name is Simon and I am a PhD student at King's College London and member of the [MeTriCs Lab](https://metrics-lab.github.io/). My PhD project is supervised by [Dr.Emma C. Robinson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=fr&user=WXAAOb0AAAAJ) and [Pr. Daniel Rueckert](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H0O0WnQAAAAJ&hl=fr).

My research work lies in developing new **deep learning** methods for studying **neuroimaging data**, especially for MRI and fMRI, with a particular interest in studying **neonatal cortical development and neurological disorders**. 

Currently, I am developing deep learning methodologies for studying brain surface features using **vision transformers**.

**Updates:**

- Our latest work on ***Surface Vision Transformers*** is currently under review for the MIDL 2022 conference ([Link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=mpp843Bsf-))
